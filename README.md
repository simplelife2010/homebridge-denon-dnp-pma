Homebridge plugin for controlling a Denon amplifier via a Denon network player
## Overview
It is possible to remote control a Denon PMA-1600NE amplifier via a Denon DNP-730AE network player.
The amplifier has no network connection, but when connected to the network player via a remote control
cable, some features of the amplifier are accessible via the network player's http interface, for example
switching between power on and standby, or increasing/decreasing the amplifier's volume.
This plugin makes the amplifier' features available for a HomeKit setup.
